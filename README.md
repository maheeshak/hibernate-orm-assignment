# Hibernate ORM Assignment
This Java project focuses on assessing students' ability to use Hibernate for performing CRUD operations on a single entity (Book) and managing relationships between entities (Book and Author).

## Part 1: CRUD Operations on a Single Entity
Tasks:

**ðŸ‘Œ** Set up a Java project with Java JDK 11, MySQL 8.0.32, Hibernate Core 6.2.6.Final, and Lombok 1.18.26 dependencies.

**ðŸ‘Œ** Create the Book entity class with appropriate annotations for mapping.

**ðŸ‘Œ** Implement CRUD operations for the Book entity: Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete.

**ðŸ‘Œ** Test the CRUD operations using a simple console-based application.


## Part 2: Relationships between Entities (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many)
Tasks:

**ðŸ‘Œ** Create the Book and Author entity classes with Hibernate annotations.

**ðŸ‘Œ** Implement relationships using Hibernate annotations: One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many.

**ðŸ‘Œ** Implement tasks related to relationships: Save and associate Author and Book entities accordingly.

**ðŸ‘Œ** Test the relationships to ensure they are correctly maintained.
